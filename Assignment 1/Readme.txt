CO2 emissions per capita in Europe
3D Physical object

For this task I used a dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions. I made a 3D graph with this data. Every graph on the Z-axis is a European country. The X-axis is the time from 1995 to 2016. The Y-axis is the amount of COÂ² emitted.
