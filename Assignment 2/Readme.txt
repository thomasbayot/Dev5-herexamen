My steps in 2020

Here I used a personal dataset and NodeBox to make a exploratory bubble graph. 
I exported all my health data from my phone and made a usable csv of it. I used my steps and calories from the data from 01/01/2020 to 30/06/2020. As second data I used the weather of every day.
Every day I made a bubble. The radius is the amount of steps and the colour is the amount of burned calories for that day. The Y-position of the bubble is the temperature of that day and on the X-axis is the date.

So now I can see if the weather has an impact on my daily steps and my calories.
