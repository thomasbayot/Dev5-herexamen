Corona Cases

For this task I made a datavisual with squares in Illustrator. Every group of squares is a country and every square is representing the numbers for the cases, deaths and cured people.

The amount of cases, deaths or cured is the surface area of a square devided
by 6 for scale.

With this visual it is easy to see which countries are most affected by the virus. Also, it represents what the ratios are between the numbers.
